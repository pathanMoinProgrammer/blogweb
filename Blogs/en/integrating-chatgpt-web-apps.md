Web developers are turning to ChatGPT for real-time content generation, from chatbots to personalized recommendations. Its OpenAI API is more mature than Gemini's, offering easier setup and finer control.

## Best Practices for Success

Start with prompt engineering to tailor outputs, then scale with caching. Gemini's API, while promising, lacks ChatGPT's community plugins for rapid prototyping.

- Secure API keys with environment variables
- Handle rate limits for high-traffic sites
- Test for hallucinations in user-facing features

With ChatGPT's ecosystem, web apps become smarter fasterâ€”Gemini may catch up, but for now, it's the integration king.
