Customer service has evolved from scripted calls to AI-driven conversations, with ChatGPT leading the charge through its nuanced understanding of tone and context. Gemini, while efficient, often feels more robotic in emotional scenarios.

## Implementation Strategies

Businesses integrating ChatGPT report 30% faster resolution times, thanks to its adaptive learning. Pair it with analytics for personalized follow-ups that Gemini's structured outputs can't match yet.

- Train on company-specific jargon for accuracy
- Use sentiment analysis to escalate human intervention
- Monitor for over-reliance to maintain authenticity

The future of support lies in AI that feels humanâ€”ChatGPT's edge here positions it as the go-to for service teams aiming to delight customers.
