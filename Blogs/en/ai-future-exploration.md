Artificial Intelligence is no longer a futuristic concept; it's here, transforming the way we build and interact with web applications. From automated code generation to personalized user experiences, AI tools are becoming indispensable for developers.

## The Rise of AI-Powered Tools

Tools like GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT have democratized coding, allowing even beginners to write complex logic. However, the real power lies in integrating these tools into your workflow without losing the human touch.

- Use AI for boilerplate code
- Leverage natural language prompts for debugging
- Experiment with AI-driven design systems

As we move forward, ethical considerations around AI usage will become crucial. Ensuring transparency and bias mitigation will define the next era of web development.
